## Background

This website is inspired by a passion of mine, the guitar. I wanted to make a site about a topic which I both enjoy and have a good knowledge of. This knowledge is especially helpful reagrding usability and ensuring that the right content is delivered to the right audience.

## Structure

The site is comprised of four pages.
These are as follows:
* Homepage
* A page about famous guitar models
* A page about famous guitar players
* An about page

## Site Map
A site map illustrates the layout of the site, listing the included pages.
This site does not include a site map because all of the pages are readily accessible form the nav bar. With this in mind the respective images are included below showing the traditional layout and the specific links between the pages.

## HTML
HTML is all valid across the site. Check the respective links listed below under each web page. 
HTML5 semantic tags have been used to order organise elements. The original code was slightly disjointed, I had not fully understood the concept of specific tags and there uses. For this reason, the html was not perfectly organised, with elements like asides and articles originally included. However, through further study and reading over course material I learnt when and where to use the appropriate tags.

## CSS
CSS contains no errors

## JavaScript
The JavaScript has no console errors.

## Responsive and Mobile First Design
One of the main goals for the project is to program for responsive design. The CSS was programmed to be responsive, using a number of breakpoints, three. One for mobile, one for tablet and one for desktop.
The breakpoints were chosen according to [2]. 
The breakpoints themselves are evident in the CSS files. Below is a screenshot regardless:

## Page-by-page breakdown

### Home
The home page serves to do just that, act as the home page. It is the main page of the site and the first point of contact with users. For this reason it is important that it gives the general idea about the site, its aims and its general style.
It has a quick welcome banner, a nice friendly introduction to users. This is followed by a number some basic friendly information about the site.
Three text boxes are separated by two buttons, allowing for a symmetrical design whil incorporating quick access to other parts of the website immediately.
The sketch below shows the original version of the page, the initial ideas upon designing it.

### Wonderful Stringed Things
This is the first page of main content which the site revolves around. It gives informtion about particular models of guitar.
Accordions were chosen for this page becuase it allows users to quickly glance over the listed content without going into details, simply viewing the subject.
