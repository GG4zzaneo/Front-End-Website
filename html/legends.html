			<p>The select group of people who truly made us rock and have even changed people's lives! These musicians wielded the precious axe like so few could even dream of. Apologies if we have missed anyone, the truth is we probably considered them but would be here for eternity if we included everyone!

						<p>Where on earth do we begin? Hendrix is the true God of guitars, the one who truly set rock in motion. He wielded the guitar like no one else ever did and as no one has since. The things this man did with the guitar in teh 60's were unimaginable. Imagine the shock on peoples faces when they heard Voodoo Child or Purple Haze for the first time. Every note was an emotion with Hendrix, every song, a canvas on which his work would be painted. This visionary laid the foundations for the vast majority of guitar players, certainly the best, that have come since. All we can say is thankyou Jimi!</p>

The only person the achieve such an accolade, Clapton is arguably the best guitarist the British Isles has ever produced. The fact he has worked with almost everyone is testament to his natural ability and wide skillset. He has written some of the best riffs on some of the best tones of all time, namely that Layla riff with his famous woman tone. As they say, Clapton is God.</p>

His work is so simple in its execution that it can be hard for others to replicate. He plays with a certain swagger and attitude that music is missing today. He wrote some of the most iconic music of all time in a band that rivalled the beatles at its height. One thing is sure for Keith Richards, he will NOT FADE AWAY.</p>

His music revolutionised the entire industry and kicked rock and roll into the mainstream. His simple advancement of the blues into rock n roll led to the greats we now have today. He was the first along with Elvis to focus on showmanship as part of the act an one of the first to include lengthy and catchy solos into his work. Chuck's songs just make you want to get up off for feet and rock, thanks Chuck.</p>

His vibrato technique is unrivalled, with even Hendirx and SRV citing King as heavy influences on their career. B.B played like no other, with such a relaxed demeanour on stage, reflected in his music. A blues you could truly sway to and appreciate. His name said it all, King, King of the blues.</p>

Regardless, his finger tapping technique set him apart from anyone that had gone before, playing with such speed and perfection that made him the legend he is today. He went so far as to create his own frankestrat in order to stop others from stealing his sound. Don't worry Eddie, I don't think they could even if they wanted to.</p>

His versatility and warm hearted nature made him a favourite among other musicians, cooperating with many until his death in 2001. Harrison was instrumental in introducing the western world to the wonders of the sitar and other Asian muscial instruments and sounds.

Yes, indeed, Pete Townshend. A maverick with some real anger to take out on expensive gear. He was one of the first musicians to integrate the synth into mainstream music, with his masterpiece of Baba O'Reilly being the standout example. His imagination and personality has influenced many musicians, ask Pete and he'll tell you he can't explain.</p>

His unique riffs and chord progressions set him apart, ripping away at the heavy metal and endless solos of the 80s, he and Morrisey laid waste to the Hair spray and leather trouser rockstars with some outstanding work. It is no surprise the Smiths are regularly touted as the best British band of all time, even above the Beatles. NME hailed him as a Godlike genius and rightly so, this charming man came up with some truly fantastic and melodic riffs that influenced a plethora of yound artists and ed to the rise of the indie rock band.

Gallagher wrote and still writes songs that few others can, songs that mean something to everybody, that evoke an inner emotion. Having grown up listening to his music we have seen his development over the years. In many respects, he was the force behind the last truly rock and roll phenomenom.

He mixed the melody and songwriting of the Beatles with the power chords and distortion of all gret rock bands that came before. In many ways, Cobain was the last real musical messiah, part of a select group of musicians who reach people beyond the context of their work. He defined a generation and will never be forgotten.</p>

He was voted 'Best Fender Guitar Player Ever' in a poll in Guitarist magazine, beating such greats as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. Rather strangely, Gilmour doesn't like his own tone, which is strange given his success and sheer ability, w=one thing is for sure, his bank account certainly likes his tone. He is such guitar legend that he was given one of the first ever stratocasters produced by Fender in the 50s. For dave its just another guitar and another brick in the wall.</p>

It says volumes about Frusciante's song writing that the Chili Pepper's sound has not been the same since he left. Songs like Under the Bridge and Snow are such amazingly complex and beautiful songs that they alone could set him a place in this pantheon. He fused two very different genres of rock and roll and funk into his own sound, the Chili Pepper sound which help revolutionise rock in teh 90s. His technique was unparalleled in his generation and has influenced many current and budding guitarists.</p>
