				<p>The select group of people who truly made us rock and have even changed people's lives! These musicians wielded the precious axe like so few could even dream of. Apologies if we have missed anyone, the truth is we probably considered them but would be here for eternity if we included everyone!<p>

				<h2>Jimi Hendrix</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/jim.jpg" alt="Jimi Hendrix">
					<aside>
						<p>Born: 1942</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Fender Stratocaster</p>
						<p>Genre: Psychedelic Rock - Rock</p>
						<p>Band: The Jimi Hendrix Experience</p>
						<p>Best work: Voodoo Child</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Where on earth do we begin? Hendrix is the true God of guitars, the one who truly set rock in motion. He wielded the guitar like no one else ever did and as no one has since. The things this man did with the guitar in teh 60's were unimaginable. Imagine the shock on peoples faces when they heard Voodoo Child or Purple Haze for the first time. Every note was an emotion with Hendrix, every song, a canvas on which his work would be painted. This visionary laid the foundations for the vast majority of guitar players, certainly the best, that have come since. All we can say is thankyou Jimi!</p>

				<h2>Stevie Ray Vaughn</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/srv.jpg" alt="Stevie Ray Vaughn">
					<aside>
						<p>Born: 1954</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Fender Stratocaster</p>
						<p>Genre: Blues Rock - Texas Blues</p>
						<p>Band: Double Trouble</p>
						<p>Best work: Pride and Joy</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Who next on the list but the nearest incarntion to Hendrix that the world has seen. This man was so good that he nearly rivalled the man himself. Stevie Ray Vaughn was so good that he brought the blues back from the dead in the 80s and made it fashionable again. Such was his mastery that he arguably performed Voodoo Child better than Jimi Hendrix, perfecting every little niche within the song, adding his own vibrancy and story.</p>

				<h2>Eric Clapton</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/clap.jpg" alt="Jimi Hendrix">
					<aside>
						<p>Born: 1945</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Fender Stratocaster</p>
						<p>Genre: Blues Rock</p>
						<p>Band: Cream</p>
						<p>Best work: Sunshine of your Love</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Clapton. So good that they inducted him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame not once, not twice but three times. The only person the achieve such an accolade, Clapton is arguably the best guitarist the British Isles has ever produced. The fact he has worked with almost everyone is testament to his natural ability and wide skillset. He has written some of the best riffs on some of the best tones of all time, namely that Layla riff with his famous woman tone. As they say, Clapton is God.</p>

				<h2>Jimmy Page</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/page.jpg" alt="Jimmy Page">
					<aside>
						<p>Born: 1944</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Gibson Les Paul</p>
						<p>Genre: Rock - Hard Rock</p>
						<p>Band: Led Zeppelin</p>
						<p>Best work: Stairway to Heaven</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Another Jimmy on the list and another multiple Hall of Fame inductee, Page was cut from a special cloth. His guitar sound defined the 70's in the truly gargantuan Led Zeppelin. He was the soul and centre of their music. Robert Plant may have been the front man but Jimmy Page was the main man. The man was so good that Gibson produced a double necked guitar just for him to use on that most famous of Zeppelin songs, Stairway to Heaven.</p>

				<h2>Keith Richards</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/keith.jpg" alt="Keith Richards">
					<aside>
						<p>Born: 1943</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Fender Telecaster</p>
						<p>Genre: Blues Rock</p>
						<p>Band: The Rolling Stones</p>
						<p>Best work: Gimme Shelter</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Keith Richards is what all guitarists aim to be, masters of the simple stuff. Aside from his off stage antics (we won't go there), Keith is an astoundingly remarkable guitarist. His work is so simple in its execution that it can be hard for others to replicate. He plays with a certain swagger and attitude that music is missing today. He wrote some of the most iconic music of all time in a band that rivalled the beatles at its height. One thing is sure for Keith Richards, he will NOT FADE AWAY.</p>

				<h2>Chuck Berry</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/chuck.jpg" alt="Chuck Berry">
					<aside>
						<p>Born: 1926</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Gibson ES-335</p>
						<p>Genre: Rock n Roll</p>
						<p>Band: Chuck Berry</p>
						<p>Best work: Johnny B.Goode</p>
					</aside>
					<p>This is arguably the man that started it all. The late Chcuk Berry was a maestro before his time, no one had the swagger this man had, least of all in the 50s. His music revolutionised the entire industry and kicked rock and roll into the mainstream. His simple advancement of the blues into rock n roll led to the greats we now have today. He was the first along with Elvis to focus on showmanship as part of the act an one of the first to include lengthy and catchy solos into his work. Chuck's songs just make you want to get up off for feet and rock, thanks Chuck.</p>

				<h2>B.B. King</h2>

						<p>Born: 1925</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Gibson ES-335</p>
						<p>Genre: Blues</p>
						<p>Band: B.B King</p>
						<p>Best work: The Thrill Is Gone</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Another legend who has passed into the pantheon, King was a revolutionary at a time when no one dared to be. He brought blues to the nation and more importantly at the time, to a white audience, propelling him and his genre contemporaries into the limelight. His vibrato technique is unrivalled, with even Hendirx and SRV citing King as heavy influences on their career. B.B played like no other, with such a relaxed demeanour on stage, reflected in his music. A blues you could truly sway to and appreciate. His name said it all, King, King of the blues.</p>

				<h2>Eddie Van Halen</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/evh.jpg" alt="Eddie Van Halen">
					<aside>
						<p>Born: 1955</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Frankenstrat/p>
						<p>Genre: Hard Rock - Heavy Metal</p>
						<p>Band: Van Halen</p>
						<p>Best work: Eruption</p>
					</aside>
					<p>EVH defined a genre and inspired more children to pick up the guitar than any other player. He was a force of nature and developed his own style, a style so outrageous that few can mimic it with meaning. He has even topped Hendrix on various lists for the best guitarist. Regardless, his finger tapping technique set him apart from anyone that had gone before, playing with such speed and perfection that made him the legend he is today. He went so far as to create his own frankestrat in order to stop others from stealing his sound. Don't worry Eddie, I don't think they could even if they wanted to.</p>

				<h2>George Harrison</h2>

						<p>Born: 1943</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Rickenbacker 330</p>
						<p>Genre: Rock</p>
						<p>Band: The Beatles</p>
						<p>Best work: My Sweet Lord</p>
					</aside>
					<p>The quiet one. The best one as we believe. A hugely underrated guitarist, by far the most capable of all of the Beatles. George was the secret weapon, the one who was able to fill out all the gaps in the beatles songs and provide some of the most catchy and unique riffs of all time. His versatility and warm hearted nature made him a favourite among other musicians, cooperating with many until his death in 2001. Harrison was instrumental in introducing the western world to the wonders of the sitar and other Asian muscial instruments and sounds. George was a fiercely popular musician and guitarist, truly the Sweet Lord of music.</p>

				<h2>Pete Townshend</h2>

						<p>Born: 1945</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Rickenbacker 330</p>
						<p>Genre: Rock</p>
						<p>Band: The Who</p>
						<p>Best work: Baba O'Reilly</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Townshend was the first of his kind. The first rocker with a real attitude, who utilised power chords like few before. Alongside Roger Daltry he was the creative force in one of the best bands of all time, the Who. All of tehse rock stars who like to smash their equipment, guess who they got their inspiration from? Yes, indeed, Pete Townshend. A maverick with some real anger to take out on expensive gear. He was one of the first musicians to integrate the synth into mainstream music, with his masterpiece of Baba O'Reilly being the standout example. His imagination and personality has influenced many musicians, ask Pete and he'll tell you he can't explain.</p>

				<h2>Johnny Marr</h2>

						<p>Born: 1963</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Gibson ES-335</p>
						<p>Genre: Alternative Rock</p>
						<p>Band: The Smiths</p>
						<p>Best work: Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now</p>
					</aside>
					<p>In our opinion, the best British guitarist of all time. Few guitarists can invent their own style of play and their own sound and Marr was one of them. His unique riffs and chord progressions set him apart, ripping away at the heavy metal and endless solos of the 80s, he and Morrisey laid waste to the Hair spray and leather trouser rockstars with some outstanding work. It is no surprise the Smiths are regularly touted as the best British band of all time, even above the Beatles. NME hailed him as a Godlike genius and rightly so, this charming man came up with some truly fantastic and melodic riffs that influenced a plethora of yound artists and ed to the rise of the indie rock band. Johnny F*ckin Marr, we salute you!</p>

				<h2>Noel Gallagher</h2>

						<p>Born: 1967</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Gibson Les Paul</p>
						<p>Genre: Rock</p>
						<p>Band: Oasis</p>
						<p>Best work: The Masterplan</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Noel Gallagher is not necessarily the best guiarist in the world, but he is certainly one of the most influential. He was the creative core of Oasis, the biggest British band since the Beatles. Every song he wrote in between the years of 1994-1997 seemed to be adored by the masses, and rightly so. Gallagher wrote and still writes songs that few others can, songs that mean something to everybody, that evoke an inner emotion. Having grown up listening to his music we have seen his development over the years. In many respects, he was the force behind the last truly rock and roll phenomenom. One thing is for sure with Noel, his music will live forever.</p>

				<h2>Kurt Cobain</h2>

						<p>Born: 1967</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Fender Jaguar</p>
						<p>Genre: Grunge</p>
						<p>Band: Nirvana</p>
						<p>Best work: Smells Like Teen Spirit</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Cobain was an extraordinary musician, a true wordsmith who's words would resound through the hearts of all listeners. His music shifted the entire music landscape in the early 90's, twisting the industry completely. semingly overnight with the release of Smells Like teen Spirit. He mixed the melody and songwriting of the Beatles with the power chords and distortion of all gret rock bands that came before. In many ways, Cobain was the last real musical messiah, part of a select group of musicians who reach people beyond the context of their work. He defined a generation and will never be forgotten.</p>

				<h2>David Gilmour</h2>

						<p>Main Ax: Fender Stratocaster</p>
						<p>Genre: Progressive Rock</p>
						<p>Band: Pink Floyd</p>
						<p>Best work: Comfortably Numb</p>
					</aside>
					<p>Gilmour was the king of the clean tone. He oozed such classe when putting together some of the best riffs and bends of all time back in the 70s. He joined Pink Floyd and transformed the band's ideas and sound instantly. He was voted 'Best Fender Guitar Player Ever' in a poll in Guitarist magazine, beating such greats as Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. Rather strangely, Gilmour doesn't like his own tone, which is strange given his success and sheer ability, w=one thing is for sure, his bank account certainly likes his tone. He is such guitar legend that he was given one of the first ever stratocasters produced by Fender in the 50s. For dave its just another guitar and another brick in the wall.</p>

				<h2>John Frusicante</h2>
				<article>
					<img src="../images/john.jpg" alt="John Frusciante">

						<p>Born: 1970</p>
						<p>Main Ax: Fender Stratocaster</p>
						<p>Genre: Alternative Rock</p>
						<p>Band: Red Hot Chili Peppers</p>
						<p>Best work: Under The Bridge</p>
					</aside>
					<p>One of the best have been saved for last. Frusciante is a living legend and another disciple of Hendrix. He was the key, along with bassist Flea in one of the best bands of all time, the Chili Peppers. It says volumes about Frusciante's song writing that the Chili Pepper's sound has not been the same since he left. Songs like Under the Bridge and Snow are such amazingly complex and beautiful songs that they alone could set him a place in this pantheon. He fused two very different genres of rock and roll and funk into his own sound, the Chili Pepper sound which help revolutionise rock in teh 90s. His technique was unparalleled in his generation and has influenced many current and budding guitarists.</p>
