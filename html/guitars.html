            </ul>
            <p>Arguably the most iconic guitar of all time. This was developed by the man it was named after, the one and only Mr. Les Paul. It has sat in the hands of some of the greatest players of all time. Who? Well theres Slash, Jimmy Page, Johnny Marr, Duane Allman, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend just to name but a few.</p>

            <p>Again, arguably the most iconic guitar of all time. Developed by Mr. Leo Fender, who strangely was not a guitar player, this is arguably the most versatile guitar of all time. You name a genre, it's more than liekly that this six-stringed devil has featured at some point. If it's good enough for Hendrix it's good enough for any mere mortal! Need we say any more?</p>

            <p class="right">The original rock and roll guitar! You know that riff from the end of Back to the Future? Yup, you guessed, that had ES-335 all over it. This was arguably, the guitar of the 50's and early 60's. Such a beautiful guitar that Noel Gallagher actually decided he wanted to be a rockstar based solely on Johnny Marr's red ES-335.</p>

              <li>Fret: Maple</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The guitar that really started it all. This is just an absolute classic with a pure minimalist design, the design with which Leo Fender beat Gibson to market with int he race for the first solid body guitar! This is once again an extremely versatile guitar by Fender but is arguably best suited to either a completely clean channel or some light distortion. Just listen to Can't Get No (Satisfaction) by the Stones, yup. Tele.</p>

            <p>Here's one for the original metalheads. This unique guitar was designed as the original shredder, with the intention to have the fastest guitar neck in the world. Who are we to argue? Just ask Tommy Iommi or Angus Young, two of the most powerful guitarists ever, what did they wield? That's right, the SG.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Designed as the original surf guitar back in the early 60's it initially found fame in the hands of the beach boys. However, as rock n roll set in, the Jag was forgotten. Until the 90's when the alternative scene hit hard with bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana. Think of that Under the Bridge intro, that is the tone of a pure, compressed, Fender Jaguar, what a tone!</p>

            <p>This was an experimental guitar from the lates 50's. What a truly iconic design. Can you imagine seeing this in the 50's?! This is a true classic of heavy rock, even Hendrix was convinced enough to set down his Fenders from time to time to shred on this unique guitar.</p>

            <p>A unique guitar in more ways than one. First of all is that assymetrical appearance with the beautiful pick-guard and then there is the sound. This is arguably the most jangly sound you can imagine, think of This Charming Man by the Smiths. That jangle is all down to the 330, how charming!</p>

            <p>This guitar was not meant to exist but was so popular as a prototype that they decided the had to put it into production immediately.

            <p>Martin are the kings of the acoustic guitar. Th D-28 is the king of the Martin acoustics. Ergo, the D-28 is the king of the acoustics, or at least we think so. This guitar oozes class, from the highest quality of its wood to the smoothest sound which sets it apart form the competition. Kurt Cobain and Eric Clapton chose these for their respective unplugged session. Needless to say, we aren't all that surprised.</p>
