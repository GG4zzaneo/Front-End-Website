          <p>This site was designed to express my passion for the guitar, one of the most versatile and magical instruments in the world. It has played a part in many great songs down the years at the hands of great players. I felt the need to pay homage to those who have graced the stage like few others and inspired generations to play as well as honour to the instruments they played.</p>

          <p>I was never interested in music as a child. Many of my friends growing up played a variety of instruments but I shared no mutual desire to learn any. This was until the age of 12 however. On Christmas morning, I woke to find an acoustic sitting under the tree. From the moment I strummed the first chord I was hooked and haven't looked back since.</p>

          <p>Where to start? The guitar is one of the few things in this crazy world which provides escapism. It lets you express youself in all moments. Through times of sadness or joy to excitement and boredom. The therapeutic and energetic nature of playing the guitar is addictive, allowing for an unrivalled joy while you improve your skills along the way! It's a win-win.</p>

          <p>My future ambitions are to form a band, writing good music with nice melodies. Who knows, we might even get signed and release a new anthem for the ages! One things for sure, guitar music needs to be plucked out of the abyss and forced back into the mainstream! Aside from this dream, I hope to enjoy playing the guitar for many years to come, be it with friends and family or just sitting in my room with an acoustic.</p>
